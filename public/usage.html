      <h1>How to Use the Attendance Calculation App</h1>
      <div class="instructions">
        <h2>1. Opening the App:</h2>
        <p>
          Open the app either on your computer or mobile device. Ensure you have
          a stable internet connection.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Understanding the Interface:</h2>
        <p>
          When the app opens, you'll see a form with input fields for males,
          females, children, and cars. These fields are where you input the
          attendance data.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Entering Attendance Data:</h2>
        <p>
          Start by entering the number of males, females, and children who
          attended your event or gathering in their respective input fields. If
          there were cars involved (for example, if it's a driving event), enter
          the number of cars in the designated field.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Calculating Total Attendance:</h2>
        <p>
          After entering all the attendance data, click the
          <strong class="code">"Calculate Total Attendance"</strong> button.
          This action will calculate and display the total attendance for males,
          females, children, and cars.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Generating a Report:</h2>
        <p>
          Once the total attendance is calculated, you can click the
          <strong class="code">"Print Report"</strong> button to generate a PDF
          report summarizing the attendance details. The report includes the
          number of males, females, children, and cars, making it easy to share
          and review the attendance information.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Sharing the Report (Optional):</h2>
        <p>
          To share the PDF report, you can upload it to a cloud storage service
          like Google Drive or Dropbox and then share the link with others.
          Alternatively, if you have a WhatsApp account and the necessary
          permissions, you can use the app to send the PDF report directly to a
          WhatsApp number.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Reviewing the Total Attendance:</h2>
        <p>
          After generating the report, you'll also see the total attendance
          displayed within the app interface. This summary helps you quickly
          check the overall attendance figures.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Closing the App:</h2>
        <p>
          Once you've finished using the app and reviewing the attendance data,
          you can close the app or navigate to other sections as needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you encounter any issues or have questions while using the app,
          feel free to refer to the app's documentation or seek assistance from
          the app's support team. Happy attendance tracking!
